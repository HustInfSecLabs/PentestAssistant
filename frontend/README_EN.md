# PentestAssistant Frontend

The frontend of the Web penetration detection assistant is developed based on the React framework and using Ant Design components. It supports user conversations and history retention.

The project is built using pnpm. The address of the backend API service can be modified in `src/config.js`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Configuration

First, make sure that the `node.js` environment exists on your computer. We recommend using pnpm. If it is not installed, you need to use npm to install it globally.

```shell
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start-up

**Development phase**: Start a local development server and support hot modification when changing. The listening port of this server can be modified in `craco.config.js`, and the project defaults to port 8002.

```shell
pnpm start
```

**Deployment phase**: Optimize, compress and package to generate static files for production environment.

```shell
pnpm build
```
